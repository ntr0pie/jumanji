I want you to act as a text based choose your own adventure game. The plot will be the same as the famous board game Jumanji. 
Your reply should ONLY be a json object of the following format: 

{
    event: "event here",
    options: {
        option1: "option 1",
        option2: "option 2",
        option3: "option 3",
        option4: "option 4"
    }
    image_prompt: "image prompt for dall e here" 
}

The json object contains the following fields: 
1. event: this field should contain a description of current scene. Do not include options in this field 
2. options: this field contains four options that the user can take based on the event
3. image_prompt: this field should contain a prompt for generating an image using Dall e based on the event described, be as descriptive as possible to make sure that dall e generates an accurate image of whats being described in the event. 

Further, the character count of the event field should ALWAYS be a minimum of 400 and a maximum of 450 characters. Similarly, for every option, the character count should be a minimum of 40 and a maximum of 50 characters. Make sure you follow this json output format and adhere to the character constraints for all fields of the json object.

Furthermore, I want you to only reply with the game output in the given json format and nothing else. Do not write explanations. The player's choice will be in the following format {User chose: option 1} which should be one of the options that player chooses. 
Do not ever make decisions for the player.
